# melee-ts-hooks
SPA for exploring SSBM frame data. Built with TS and React hooks. Special thanks to [Smashboards](https://smashboards.com/)

# Objectives

## <b>General</b>

- [ ] JSON data for main characters are now ready for display - develop front-end as needed
- [x] ~~Build web scraper for getting data from the wiki sites since it seems there aren't any ready-made CSV/Google sheet files of the frame data available.~~
- [x] Input data into a JSON file (see below, some more characters still todo)
